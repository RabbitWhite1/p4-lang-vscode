## Known Issues

- I am just a starter of vscode extension, looking forward to more people to join me.

### Syntax

- when visiting member, still need to judge whether it is a function or variable.
- only deal with what I know for now, not according to the official language manual.

### Semantic

- Now only a sample semantic highlight for `#include`, I will plan to completely do this.
