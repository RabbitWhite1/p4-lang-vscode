### What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
* `syntaxes/p4.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

### Install your extension

* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.

## Known Issues

- I am just a starter of vscode extension, looking forward to more people to join me.

### Syntax

- when visiting member, still need to judge whether it is a function or variable.
- only deal with what I know for now, not according to the official language manual.

### Semantic

- Now only a sample semantic highlight for `#include`, I will plan to completely do this.
- TODO: provide a `TypeDefinitionProvider`
